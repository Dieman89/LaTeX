  abstract = {Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) enables communication between machines with configured addresses. Part of the burden a network administrator must face is address assignment and parameter distribution for all machines on the network. Commonly, this is a process in which the administrator dictates the configuration to each user, allowing the user to configure his own machine. However, misconfigurations and misunderstandings can generate service calls that the administrator must deal with individually. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) gives the network administrator a method to remove the end user from this configuration problem and maintain the network configuration in a centralized location.},
