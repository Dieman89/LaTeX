This project required a lot of time and the minimum I can do is to thanks the support of my friends and family. \emph{Thank You for everything!}

Also, a huge thank you to supervisor \textbf{\myProfTitle} \textbf{\myProfFirstName} \textbf{\myProfLastName} for support me throughout this year. I have been lucky to have you!
