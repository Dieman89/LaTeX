  The &#x60;ID&#x60; scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as &#x60;&quot;4&quot;&#x60;) or integer (such as &#x60;4&#x60;) input value will be accepted as an ID.
