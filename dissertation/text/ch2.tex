The data that will be used to generate the documentation and used within the
software is not connected anyhow to any individual or company. The source of
truth will be a schema that is a representation of the data that could be used
to auto-generate the documentation and might point bad actors to write malicious
queries, hence why it is suggested to have schema and the documentation private.
If by any chance there might be data into field descriptions that could be used,
it will be processed securely as it will not be stored in any database
and directly served to the end user locally without traversing the web, following
the Data Protection Act-1998 \citep{legislation.gov.ukDataProtectionAct2022}.
