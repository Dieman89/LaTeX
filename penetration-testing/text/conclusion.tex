I found the whole module a very interesting one and gave me the possibility to
go deeper into topics that I didn't know much before. Even though I really
enjoyed the module as a whole, I wish there were less time consuming research
type of tasks such as Lab 3 and Lab 4. I also think the transition between the
previous labs and the last 2 had a very large gap in difficulty. Overall, a
really nice structure module, probably the best in the three years here at
Greenwich.
