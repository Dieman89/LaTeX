Network Security module has been fun to do. It introduced me to securiCAD which
I have never used before but I find it very interesting, especially since they
recently built Vanguard that simulated attacks on a virtual model for AWS.
I will surely open a spike and investigate the product further as it could be
a valuable asset to have.
