To install the softwares that are needed for the tasks, I firstly download the
installation script from the ftp server through wget command, give it the right
permissions to run and then run it.

The application to reverse engineer is then downloaded as well.

The folder contains two files ending x64 and x86 and for this task I will be
working on the x84.

The output of the script is the following:
