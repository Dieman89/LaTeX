  abstract = {"In 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen, including the first-ever blackouts triggered by hackers. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world's largest companies--from drug manufacturing to software to shipping. At the attack's epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damage--the largest, most devastating cyberattack the world had ever seen. The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in history: Sandworm. Working in the service of Russia's military intelligence agency, they represent a persistent, highly skilled, state-sponsored force, one whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries. They target government and private sector, military and civilians alike. A chilling, globe-spanning detective story, Sandworm considers the danger this force poses to our national stability and security. As the Kremlin's role in meddling in the 2016 election, manipulating foreign governments, and sparking chaos comes into greater focus, Sandworm exposes the realities not just of Russia's global digital offensive, but of an era where warfare ceases to be waged on the battlefield. It reveals how the line between digital and physical conflict, between wartime and peacetime, have begun to blur--with world-shaking implications"--},

  abstract = {Many applications today are using an encrypted channel to secure their communication and transactions. Though, their security is often challenged by adversaries such as Botnet. Botnet leverages the encrypted channel to launch attacks and amplify the impact of attacks. The numbers of Botnet attacks over an encrypted channel are increasing and continue to cause a great loss of money. This study proposes an encrypted Botnet detection technique based on packet header analysis. This technique does not require deep packet inspection and intense traffic analysis. However, the proposed technique requires the analysis of the features taken from the packet header, which are essential for detection. The study endeavors to show that features selected can significantly affect the classification of encrypted Botnet. Therefore, in this paper, the researchers focus on the effects of feature selection on the classification of encrypted Botnet. The researchers use different classification mode (full training and 10-fold cross-validation) mainly by using seven features (7-features) and three features (3-features). Seven features are the number of features extracted from the packet header, and after the feature selection, only three features out of the seven features have weight (value). Therefore, the three features are the most significant features from the seven features that have been extracted. Generally, the result shows that classification with three most significant features provides higher true positive compared to the 7-features classification. Different machine learning algorithms have been used for the classification. Relatively, the results show that the True Positives are higher for 3-features classification than 7-features classification.},

  abstract = {The article presents threat analysis resulting from botnet activity on the Internet. Botnet networks are a very common tool among cybercriminals. They enable the acquisition of large amounts of data from computers infected with the virus that creates the given network entirely subordinated to its creator. Currently, many unidentified botnets are a threat to Internet users. Those identified and diagnosed answer the problem of how dangerous a botnet is in the hands of cybercriminals. The article presents statistics and analysis of selected botnets. Currently, there is a decline in the interest in botnets in cybercrime, although many new threats appear, suggesting that botnets will continue to be popular and are still a dangerous weapon in the hands of criminals.}

  abstract = {GameOverZeus is a peer-to-peer botnet based on components from the earlier ZeuS trojan. The malware was created by Russian hacker Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. It is believed to have been spread through use of the Cutwail botnet.Unlike its predecessor the ZeuS trojan, Gameover ZeuS uses an encrypted peer-to-peer communication system to communicate between its nodes and its command and control servers, greatly reducing its vulnerability to law enforcement operations. The algorithm used appears to be modeled on the Kademlia P2P protocol.Scammers control and monitor Gameover ZeuS via Command and Control (C\&C) server. The virus establishes the connection to the server as soon as its malicious executable installs on the computer, at which point it can disable certain system processes, download and launch executables, or delete essential system files, making the system unusable.According to a report by Symantec, Gameover ZeuS has largely been used for banking fraud and distribution of the CryptoLocker ransomware.},
