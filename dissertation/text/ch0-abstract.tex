Since GraphQL was publicly released in 2015, many developers adopted it to create new public faced APIs,
but these are often poorly documented. Writing well-structured documentation requires time and manual work,
and the tooling currently available at the time of this paper would require technologies and frameworks lock-in.
This project aims to generate markdown files that can then be parsed in any framework of choice.
Since the output will be in markdown, the user can then use his parser to manipulate the documents and produce static
files for their frontend.
